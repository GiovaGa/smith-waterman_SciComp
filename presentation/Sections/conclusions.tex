    \begin{frame}{Moving forward}

        A number of different approaches are possible:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Using a similar approach as the ones used, \textbf{MPI} could be well suited to solve this problem: the communication between processes is much smaller than the computation done by each of them.
            \item \textbf{GPUs} could also be very effective, as the computation can proceed row by row and column by column.
            %\item \textbf{Possible improvements}
        \end{enumerate}
